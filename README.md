# Overview
This project uses the practice exercises from https://www.practicepython.org/. I did not look at the solutions and coded all the programs bymself. 
This project does not perfectly mirror everything from that website. There are a things that I changed in this project to make it better or more challenging. 

# Project lists
**1. Odd or even**
>This code returns a number if its odd or even. Then ask user for two numbers. One number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). 
If check divides evenly into num, it tells the user.

**2. Year you will turn hundred**
>This program asks for the users age and returns the date the year they will turn 100. Program uses the datetime module.

**3. Less than filter**
>A program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than the value the user typed in. 

**4. Divisor calculater***
>This code asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.

**5. Lists overlap***
>This program randomly generates numbers for 2 lists and then returns a new lists that contains numbers present on both list. The user can control how many numbers are present.

**6. Palindrome**
>Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not.

**7. Rock, paper, scissor**
> Two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

**8. Guessing game**
>This generates a random number between 1 and 9 then asks you toguess the number. It also tells whether you guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.

**9. Lists comprehension**
>Has one line of Python code that takes a list and makes a new list that has only the even elements.

**10. List overlap comprehensions**
>Reuses exercise 5 but use one line of code to compare both lists.

**11. Check primality functions**
>Reuses exercise 4 but turns old code into a function and uses list comprehension. 

**12. List ends**
>Takes a list and retuns the first and last elements of the given list.
